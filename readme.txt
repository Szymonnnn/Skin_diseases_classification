Skin Diseases Classification Project
====================================

Project Name: Skin Diseases Classification on Example of Dataset Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000

====================================
Project Description:
====================================

The "Skin Diseases Classification on Example of Dataset Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000" project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying different types of skin diseases. The project utilizes the Skin Cancer MNIST dataset, specifically the HAM10000 subset, which contains images of various skin lesions captured using dermoscopy.

====================================
Dataset Information:
====================================

The HAM10000 dataset consists of 10,015 images, each labeled with one of seven classes representing different skin diseases. The classes are as follows:

1. Melanocytic nevi
2. Melanoma
3. Benign keratosis-like lesions
4. Basal cell carcinoma
5. Actinic keratoses
6. Vascular lesions
7. Dermatofibroma

The dataset provides an excellent opportunity to train and evaluate a classification model for accurate diagnosis and identification of these skin diseases.

====================================
Project Structure:
====================================

The project is structured as follows:

1. `main.py`: Main file of directory (contains preprocessing)

2. `params.py`: All parametrs used in 'main.py'

3. `side_funcs.py`: Side functions "plot_confusion_matrix", "plot_model_history"

4. `requirements.txt`: A text file specifying the required Python libraries and their versions for running the project.

5. `README.txt`: This file providing an overview of the project, its purpose, dataset information, and the project structure.

====================================
Dependencies:
====================================

To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.11
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

```

====================================
Conclusion:
====================================

The "Skin Diseases Classification on Example of Dataset Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000" project provides a valuable opportunity to apply machine learning techniques for the accurate diagnosis and classification of skin diseases. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we can develop a model capable of assisting medical professionals in identifying various skin conditions promptly.
